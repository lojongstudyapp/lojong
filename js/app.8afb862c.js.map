May I learn to hold my aggression to myself, and may all sentient beings thereby attain freedom from aggression.”Or: “May this passion be mine. Because it belongs to me by virtue of my holding on to it, therefore may others be free of such passion.”For indifference, you do the same thing. The purpose of doing that is that when you begin to hold the three poisons as yours, when you possess them fully and completely, when you take charge of them fully, you will find, interestingly enough, that the logic is reversed. If you have no object of aggression, you cannot hold your own aggression purely by yourself. If you have no object of passion, you cannot hold your passion yourself. And in the same way, you cannot hold on to your ignorance either. By holding your poison, you let go of the object, or the intent, of your poison. You see, what usually happens is that you have objects of the three poisons. When you have an object of aggression, for example, you feel angry toward it—right? But if your anger is not directed toward something, the object of aggression falls apart. It is impossible to have an object of anger, because the anger belongs to you rather than to its object. You give your compassion to the object so that it doesn’t provoke your anger—then what are you angry with? You find yourself just hanging out there, with no one to project onto.
